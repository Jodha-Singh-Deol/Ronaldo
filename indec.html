        <p>Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro GOIH ComM (Portuguese pronunciation: [kɾiʃˈtjɐnu ʁɔˈnaɫdu]; born 5
            February 1985) is a Portuguese professional footballer who plays as a forward for and captains both Saudi
            Professional League club Al Nassr and the Portugal national team. Widely regarded as one of the greatest
            players of all time, Ronaldo has won five Ballon d'Or awards[note 3] and four European Golden Shoes, the
            most by a European player. He has won 34 trophies in his career, including seven league titles, five UEFA
            Champions Leagues, the UEFA European Championship and the UEFA Nations League. Ronaldo holds the records for
            most appearances (183), goals (140), and assists (42) in the Champions League, goals in the European
            Championship (14), international goals (118), and joint-most international appearances (196). He is one of
            the few players to have made over 1,100 professional career appearances, and has scored over 820 official
            senior career goals for club and country.

            Ronaldo began his senior career with Sporting CP, before signing with Manchester United in 2003, winning the
            FA Cup in his first season. He would also go on to win three consecutive Premier League titles, the
            Champions League and the FIFA Club World Cup; at age 23, he won his first Ballon d'Or. Ronaldo was the
            subject of the then-most expensive association football transfer when he signed for Real Madrid in 2009 in a
            transfer worth €94 million (£80 million). He became a key contributor and formed an attacking trio with
            Karim Benzema and Gareth Bale which was integral to the team winning four Champions League wins from 2014 to
            2018, including La Décima. During this period, he won back-to-back Ballons d'Or in 2013 and 2014, and again
            in 2016 and 2017, and was runner-up three times behind Lionel Messi, his perceived career rival. He also
            became the club's all-time top goalscorer and the all-time top scorer in the Champions League, and finished
            as the competition's top scorer for six consecutive seasons between 2012 and 2018. With Real, Ronaldo won
            two La Liga titles, two Copa del Rey, four Champions Leagues, three UEFA Super Cup and three Club World
            Cups. In 2018, he signed for Juventus in a transfer worth an initial €100 million (£88 million), the most
            expensive transfer for an Italian club and for a player over 30 years old. He won two Serie A titles, two
            Supercoppa Italiana trophies and a Coppa Italia, became the inaugural Serie A Most Valuable Player and the
            first footballer to finish as top scorer in the English, Spanish and Italian leagues, before returning to
            Manchester United in 2021. He left in 2022, after his contract with the club was terminated. In 2023,
            Ronaldo signed for Al Nassr.

            Ronaldo made his international debut for Portugal in 2003 at the age of 18 and has since earned over 190
            caps, making him Portugal's most-capped player. With more than 100 goals at international level, he is also
            the all-time top goalscorer. Ronaldo has played in and scored at 11 major tournaments; he scored his first
            international goal at Euro 2004, where he helped Portugal reach the final. He assumed captaincy of the
            national team in July 2008. In 2015, Ronaldo was named the best Portuguese player of all time by the
            Portuguese Football Federation. The following year, he led Portugal to their first major tournament title at
            Euro 2016, and received the Silver Boot as the second-highest goalscorer of the tournament. This achievement
            would see him receive his fourth Ballon d'Or. He also led them to a third-place finish at the 2017 FIFA
            Confederations Cup, to victory in the inaugural UEFA Nations League in 2019, receiving the top scorer award
            in the finals, and later received the Golden Boot as top scorer of Euro 2020.

            One of the world's most marketable and famous athletes, Ronaldo was ranked the world's highest-paid athlete
            by Forbes in 2016 and 2017 and the world's most famous athlete by ESPN from 2016 to 2019. Time included him
            on their list of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2014. He is the first footballer and the
            third sportsman to earn US$1 billion in his career.

            Early life
            Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro was born on 5 February 1985 in the São Pedro parish of Funchal, the
            capital of the Portuguese island of Madeira, and grew up in the nearby parish of Santo António.[8][9] He is
            the fourth and youngest child of Maria Dolores dos Santos Viveiros da Aveiro, a cook, and José Dinis Aveiro,
            a municipal gardener and part-time kit man.[10] His great-grandmother on his father's side, Isabel da
            Piedade, was from the island of São Vicente, Cape Verde.[11] He has one older brother, Hugo, and two older
            sisters, Elma and Liliana Cátia "Katia".[12] His mother revealed that she wanted to abort him due to
            poverty, his father's alcoholism, and having too many children already, but her doctor refused to perform
            the procedure.[13][14] Ronaldo grew up in an impoverished Catholic Christian home, sharing a room with all
            his siblings.[15]

            As a child, Ronaldo played for Andorinha from 1992 to 1995,[16] where his father was the kit man,[10] and
            later spent two years with Nacional. In 1997, aged 12, he went on a three-day trial with Sporting CP, who
            signed him for a fee of £1,500.[17] He subsequently moved from Madeira to Alcochete, near Lisbon, to join
            Sporting's youth academy.[17] By age 14, Ronaldo believed he had the ability to play semi-professionally and
            agreed with his mother to cease his education to focus entirely on football.[18] With a troubled life as a
            student[19] and living in Lisbon area away from his Madeiran family, he didn't complete schooling beyond the
            6th grade.[20][21] While popular with other students at school, he had been expelled after throwing a chair
            at his teacher, who he said had "disrespected" him.[18] One year later, he was diagnosed with tachycardia, a
            condition that could have forced him to give up playing football.[22] Ronaldo underwent heart surgery where
            a laser was used to cauterise multiple cardiac pathways into one, altering his resting heart rate.[23] He
            was discharged from the hospital hours after the procedure and resumed training a few days later.[24]

            Club career
            Sporting CP

            At age 16, Ronaldo was promoted from Sporting's youth team by first-team manager László Bölöni, who was
            impressed with his dribbling.[25] He subsequently became the first player to play for the club's under-16,
            under-17 and under-18 teams, the B team and the first team, all within a single season.[17] A year later, on
            29 September 2002, Ronaldo made his debut in the Primeira Liga, against Braga and on 7 October, he scored
            two goals against Moreirense in their 3–0 win.[26] Over the course of the 2002–03 season, his
            representatives suggested the player to Liverpool manager Gérard Houllier and Barcelona president Joan
            Laporta.[27] Manager Arsène Wenger, who was interested in signing Ronaldo, met with him at Arsenal's stadium
            in November to discuss a possible transfer.[28]

            Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson was determined to acquire Ronaldo on a permanent move urgently,
            after Sporting defeated United 3–1 at the inauguration of the Estádio José Alvalade in August 2003.
            Initially, United had planned to sign Ronaldo and loan him back to Sporting for a year.[29] Having been
            impressed by him, the United players urged Ferguson to sign him. After the game, Ferguson agreed to pay
            Sporting £12.24 million[29] for what he considered to be "one of the most exciting young players" he had
            ever seen.[30] A decade after his departure from the club, in April 2013, Sporting honoured Ronaldo by
            selecting him to become their 100,000th member.[31]

            Manchester United
            2003–2007: Development and breakthrough
            "There have been a few players described as 'the new George Best' over the years, but this is the first time
            it's been a compliment to me."

            —Former Manchester United player George Best hails the 18-year-old Cristiano Ronaldo in 2003.[32]
            Ronaldo's move to Manchester United was completed on 12 August 2003, too late for the 2003 FA Community
            Shield but in time for their game against Bolton Wanderers on the opening day of the 2003–04 season, and
            made him the first Portuguese player to sign for the club.[33] His transfer fee made him, at the time, the
            most expensive teenager in English football history.[34] Although he requested the number 28, his number at
            Sporting, he received the squad number 7 shirt, which had previously been worn by such United players as
            George Best, Eric Cantona and David Beckham.[35] Wearing the number 7 became an extra source of motivation
            for Ronaldo.[36] A key element in his development during his time in England proved to be Ferguson, of whom
            he later said: "He's been my father in sport, one of the most important and influential factors in my
            career."[37]</p>
